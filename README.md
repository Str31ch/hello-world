# hello-world
Testing GitHub flow

This is my first time using Github to work on version control stuff for work projects. Hopefully, once I figure this out, this will make troubleshooting much easier, so I won't have to remember what I changed in the code to remember where I came from. I also need to work out debugging inside VS code so I don't have to run the script every time to figure out what my changes will look like.
